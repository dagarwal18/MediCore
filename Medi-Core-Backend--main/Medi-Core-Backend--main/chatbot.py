PATIENT INFORMATION:
{create_patient_summary(session.data)}

RELEVANT MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE FROM DATABASE:
{kb_context}

Provide a structured clinical assessment following this exact format:

CLINICAL SUMMARY:
[Brief 2-3 sentence overview of the patient's presentation]

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Primary Consideration: [Most likely diagnosis] 
   - Clinical reasoning: [Why this is most likely]
   - Typical presentation: [How this condition usually presents]

2. Alternative Diagnosis: [Second possibility]
   - Clinical reasoning: [Why to consider this]
   - Key differentiating features: [What might distinguish this]

3. Less Likely Consideration: [Third possibility]
   - Brief rationale: [Why included in differential]

URGENCY ASSESSMENT:
Choose ONE and explain why:
- EMERGENT (Immediate care required - within minutes)
- URGENT (Same-day medical evaluation needed)
- SEMI-URGENT (Medical evaluation within 24-48 hours)
- NON-URGENT (Routine care appropriate)

CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS:

Immediate Actions:
• [Specific steps to take right now]
• [Any immediate symptom management]

Medical Care:
• [When to seek care and where]
• [What type of healthcare provider]
• [What to expect during the visit]

Self-Care Management:
• [Home care measures if appropriate]
• [Activity restrictions if any]
• [Symptom monitoring guidelines]

Red Flag Warning Signs:
• [Specific symptoms requiring immediate medical attention]
• [When to call 112 or go to ER]

FOLLOW-UP RECOMMENDATIONS:
• [When to return if symptoms persist]
• [Any specific tests or evaluations needed]

MEDICAL DISCLAIMER:
This assessment is for educational and informational purposes only. It does not constitute professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always consult qualified healthcare professionals for definitive medical care. In case of emergency, call 112 immediately.
